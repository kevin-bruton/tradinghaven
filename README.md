# Trading Haven

A Haven for Traders to make their live easier and let them have more control over their tools and their strategies.

We recommend installing "Windows Terminal" from the official Windows webpag (https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N0DX20HK701?rtc=1&hl=en-us&gl=US) or from the Microsoft Store, and settings it as the default terminal application in your settings.
